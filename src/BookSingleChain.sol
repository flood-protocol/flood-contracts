 * If a trade is not disputed within the dispute period, the relayer can call `refund` to obtain the other side of the trade it filled.
 * @notice This implementation gives immense power to the owner of the contract, and only allows one relayer / disputer. This is not intended for production use, but rather for a small scale test.
